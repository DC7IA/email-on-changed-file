This is a simple script notifying me when a file on the web changes.

It specifically notifies me when the PDF containing the next amateur radio exams in Germany changed.

It's absolute crap and I know there are ways to do it more efficiently, but so far I couln't be bothered.

I do not recommend using it. But it works for the problem I wanted to solve. :D
